<h1>LeT m3 teLl yoU someth1ng (about me)</h1>

<p>
Born in México DF (now CDMX I guess), I grew up in France. 
</p>

<p>
Most people who know me would say I am very prone to engage in multiple parallel side quests (especially when my time is limited).
</p>

<p>
So the goal of this website is to actually centralize every side quest I will be embarking on, starting from Jan 2026.
</p>

<p>
Among these side quests, 
  some are academic (finding explanations for the "fertility crisis", understanding online gender polarization, working on research replicability),
  some are computational (develop a NLP R package, translate sociodemographic trends into data visualizations, apply the principles of <em>The Nature of Code</em> to a project),
  some are personal (map the dynamic network of booktubers' recommendations and match these to my interests, develop a language learning substack)...
</p>

<p>
 This will be fun fun fun :)
